This C# command line program takes a single parameter of the name of the Aim Race Studio XRK file and produces a file by the same name + .TXT in the format used by Cosworth Pi Toolbox for outings.  
It also does some changes to the unit names so they work properly in Pi, as well as renaming some channels so they better align to PDR outings.

If you just want to run the program, download the contents of "Aim2PiToolboxv1.0.1.zip" and unzip it to the destination folder.

If you'd like to convert RaceCapture data files to Pi Toolbox, see https://gitlab.com/trackdrive925/aslrc2cpt
